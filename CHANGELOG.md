## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Skip the POSIX-only `%%bash` cell-magic test on Windows, where IPython cannot
  provide a Bash shell.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-07-24

### Removed

- Removed the optional local browser monitor, including its React and Hono
  application, event publisher, background delivery thread, environment
  configuration, and monitor-specific tests.
- Removed monitor-specific CI checks and documentation.

### Changed

- MCP tool calls and execution lifecycle handling no longer create monitoring
  side effects such as local HTTP delivery attempts or background event queues.
- PyPI releases now validate that a versioned tag matches the package version,
  run the complete Python quality gate, and validate distribution metadata
  before upload.
- Declared Pillow as a development dependency so rich presentation tests run
  in a clean CI environment.
